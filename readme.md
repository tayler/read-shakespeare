# Read Shakespeare

### Installation:
`npm install read-shakespeare

### Usage:
`node read-shakespeare.js lear.txt`
### Under the hood:
read-shakespeare uses the line-by-line package to make it through a text file.
It splits each line into its words and cleans + parses from there.
Each word is put into an object. The word is the key and the occurrance count is the value.
